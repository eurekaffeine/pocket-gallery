## Question 1
**Q:** Why are all my Pokémon images displayed as silhouettes? How can I view the original artworks? \
**A:** To mitigate the risk of infringing on the intellectual property rights of The Pokémon Company, we currently present all official artworks in silhouette form. \
However, you can switch to the original artworks by navigating to **_Settings -> Display the official artwork in "Silhouette"_**. \
