**Q:** Why are all my Pokémon images displayed as silhouettes? How can I view the original artworks? \
**A:** To mitigate the risk of infringing on the intellectual property rights of The Pokémon Company, we currently present all official artworks in silhouette form. However, you can switch to the original artworks by navigating to *Settings -> Show images in silhouette*. \
